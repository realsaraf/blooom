## 🎬 Initial Request

**User:** 
> can you build a complete app that allows me to screen record an area of the screen along with system sound. this has to be for windows 11. Also some features i need are option to pause recording, stop then save the file with location selection with defaults being saved in config, option to mute system sounds or mic sounds.
>
> in terms of choice of language you may choose any language you wish as long as i can install this app on windows, even mac support is better. standalone app is even better. 
>
> as long as the ui can be sleek and nice and fast, i dont mind the choice of language. 
>
> build the complete app. name is Blooom

## 🤖 AI Assistant Response

**GitHub Copilot:**
> I'll build a complete screen recording app called "Blooom" for you. Given your requirements for a sleek UI, cross-platform support (Windows/Mac), and standalone distribution, I'll use **Electron** with **TypeScript** and **React** for the frontend, along with native screen recording capabilities.

### Technology Stack Decision
- **Electron + React + TypeScript** for cross-platform desktop app
- **WebRTC MediaRecorder API** for screen recording
- **Web Audio API** for audio mixing
- **Electron Store** for configuration persistence
- **Webpack** for bundling
- **Electron Builder** for distribution

## 🚀 Launch Issues & Resolution

### Initial Launch Error
**User reported**: "Error launching app - Unable to find Electron app at main.js"

**Problem Identified**: 
- The main.js file wasn't being generated during build
- TypeScript compilation for main process was failing silently

**Resolution Process**:
1. **Diagnosis**: Checked dist directory contents - missing main.js and preload.js
2. **Isolated Testing**: Ran build:main separately to identify the issue
3. **Fix Applied**: Re-ran build process successfully
4. **Verification**: Confirmed all required files generated
5. **Successful Launch**: Application started correctly

### Final Status
✅ **Application Successfully Running**
- Main process compiled correctly
- Renderer process built successfully  
- All IPC communication working
- UI loading properly
- Ready for screen recording functionality
