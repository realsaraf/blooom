# Icon Placeholder

For the production version, you'll need to add the following icon files to this directory:

- `icon.png` (512x512) - Main application icon
- `icon.ico` (Windows icon file with multiple sizes)
- `icon.icns` (macOS icon file)

You can create these from a high-resolution PNG using online converters or design tools.

The icon should represent the Blooom brand - perhaps a stylized camera or recording symbol with a modern, clean design that matches the application's sleek interface.
